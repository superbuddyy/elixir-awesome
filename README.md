## Shell

[**git-secret**](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret)  —  a bash tool to store your private data inside a git repo. How’s that? Basically, it just encrypts, using gpg, the tracked files with the public keys of all the users that you trust. So everyone of them can decrypt these files using only their personal secret key. Why deal with all this private-public keys stuff? Well, to make it easier for everyone to manage access rights. There are no passwords that change. When someone is out - just delete his public key, re-encrypt the files, and he won’t be able to decrypt secrets anymore.

---
[**Lwan**](https://github.com/lpereira/lwan/) is a high-performance & scalable web server for glibc/Linux
platforms.

In development for almost 4 years, Lwan was until now a personal research
effort that focused mostly on building a **solid infrastructure** for
a lightweight and speedy web server:

  - Low memory footprint (~500KiB for 10k idle connections)
  - Minimal memory allocations & copies
  - Minimal system calls
  - Hand-crafted HTTP request parser
  - Files are served using the most efficient way according to their size
    - No copies between kernel and userland for files larger than 16KiB
    - Smaller files are sent using vectored I/O of memory-mapped buffers
    - Header overhead is considered before compressing small files
  - Mostly wait-free multi-threaded design
  - Diminute code base with roughly 7200 lines of C code

It is now transitioning into a fully working, capable HTTP server. It is
not, however, as feature-packed as other popular web servers. But it is
[free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), so scratching
your own itches and making Lwan hum the way you want it to is possible.

[**netdata**](https://github.com/firehol/netdata) is a system for distributed real-time performance and health monitoring. It provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the system it runs (including applications such as web and database servers), using modern interactive web dashboards.

netdata is fast and efficient, designed to permanently run on all systems (physical & virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their core function.

[**compojure**](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure)  —  a small routing library for Ring that allows web applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

This small Compojure application demonstrates creating a Ring handler from two routes:

```clojure
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]))
(defroutes app
  (GET "/" [] "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
  (route/not-found "<h1>Page not found</h1>"))
```

---
[**Aleph**](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph) exposes data from the network as a Manifold stream, which can easily be transformed into a java.io.InputStream, core.async channel, Clojure sequence, or many other byte representations. It exposes simple default wrappers for HTTP, TCP, and UDP, but allows access to full performance and flexibility of the underlying Netty library.

## Lisp

[**Magit**](https://github.com/magit/magit) is an interface to the version control system Git, implemented as an Emacs package. Magit aspires to be a complete Git porcelain. While we cannot claim that Magit wraps and improves upon each and every Git command, it is complete enough to allow even experienced Git users to perform almost all of their daily version control tasks directly from within Emacs. While many fine Git clients exist, only Magit and Git itself deserve to be called porcelains.

![magit](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*kPc9uZd0tipuHwz8.)

---
[**Woo**](https://github.com/fukamachi/woo) is a fast non-blocking HTTP server built on top of libev. Although Woo is written in Common Lisp, it aims to be the fastest web server written in any programming language.

![credo](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*wJ4w0yXU-HCsyPdt.)

---
[**guardian**](https://github.com/ueberauth/guardian)  —  an authentication framework for use with Elixir applications.
Guardian is based on similar ideas to Warden but is re-imagined for modern systems where Elixir manages the authentication requirements. 

Guardian remains a functional system. It integrates with Plug, but can be used outside of it. If you’re implementing a TCP/UDP protocol directly, or want to utilize your authentication via channels, Guardian is your friend.
The core currency of authentication in Guardian is JSON Web Tokens (JWT). You can use the JWT to authenticate web endpoints, channels, and TCP sockets and it can contain any authenticated assertions that the issuer wants to include.

---
[**httpoison** ](https://github.com/edgurgel/httpoison) —  yet another HTTP client for Elixir powered by hackney.

![httpoison](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/e7895297ccdfb59b971ea721eb617dc0faa9d94d/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f5777714e384a4f2e706e67)

    conn
    |> put_status(500)
    |> text("Server Error")
  end

  defp custom_error(conn, exception) do
    conn
    |> put_status(500)
    |> text(exception.message)
  end
end
```

---
[**hound**](https://github.com/HashNuke/hound)  — an  Elixir library for writing integration tests and browser automation.

ExUnit example:
```elixir

  use ExUnit.Case
  use Hound.Helpers

  hound_session

  test "the truth", meta do
    navigate_to("http://example.com/guestbook.html")

    element = find_element(:name, "message")
    fill_field(element, "Happy Birthday ~!")
    submit_element(element)

    assert page_title() == "Thank you"
  end

end
```

---
[**distillery**](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery)  —  a pure Elixir implementation of release packaging functionality for the Erlang VM (BEAM).
Every alchemist requires good tools, and one of the greatest tools in the alchemist’s disposal is the distillery. The purpose of the distillery is to take something and break it down to it’s component parts, reassembling it into something better, more powerful. That is exactly what this project does — it takes your Mix project and produces an Erlang/OTP release, a distilled form of your raw application’s components; a single package which can be deployed anywhere, independently of an Erlang/Elixir installation. No dependencies, no hassle.

This is a pure-Elixir, dependency-free implementation of release generation for Elixir projects. It is currently a standalone package, but may be integrated into Mix at some point in the future.

---
[**timex** ](https://github.com/bitwalker/timex) —  a rich, comprehensive Date/Time library for Elixir projects, with full timezone support via the :tzdata package. If you need to manipulate dates, times, datetimes, timestamps, etc., then Timex is for you! It is very easy to use Timex types in place of default Erlang types, as well as Ecto types via the timex_ecto package.

Here’s a few simple examples:
```elixir
> use Timex
> Timex.today
~D[2016-02-29]

> datetime = Timex.now
#<DateTime(2016-02-29T12:30:30.120+00:00Z Etc/UTC)

> Timex.now("America/Chicago")
#<DateTime(2016-02-29T06:30:30.120-06:00 America/Chicago)

> Duration.now
#<Duration(P46Y6M24DT21H57M33.977711S)>

> {:ok, default_str} = Timex.format(datetime, "{ISO:Extended}")
{:ok, "2016-02-29T12:30:30.120+00:00"}

> {:ok, relative_str} = Timex.shift(datetime, minutes: -3) |> Timex.format("{relative}", :relative)
{:ok, "3 minutes ago"}

> strftime_str = Timex.format!(datetime, "%FT%T%:z", :strftime)
"2016-02-29T12:30:30+00:00"

> Timex.parse(default_str, "{ISO:Extended}")
{:ok, #<DateTime(2016-02-29T12:30:30.120+00:00 Etc/Utc)}

> Timex.parse!(strftime_str, "%FT%T%:z", :strftime)
#<DateTime(2016-02-29T12:30:30.120+00:00 Etc/Utc)

> Duration.diff(Duration.now, Duration.zero, :days)
16850

> Timex.shift(date, days: 3)
~D[2016-03-03]

> Timex.shift(datetime, hours: 2, minutes: 13)
#<DateTime(2016-02-29T14:43:30.120Z Etc/UTC)>

> timezone = Timezone.get("America/Chicago", Timex.now)
#<TimezoneInfo(America/Chicago - CDT (-06:00:00))>

> Timezone.convert(datetime, timezone)
#<DateTime(2016-02-29T06:30:30.120-06:00 America/Chicago)>

> Timex.before?(Timex.today, Timex.shift(Timex.today, days: 1))
true

> Timex.before?(Timex.shift(Timex.today, days: 1), Timex.today)
false
```

Just write SQL. No bells, no whistles. This common task can be surprisingly difficult with the standard tools available. This library strives to make this workflow as simple as possible, while providing an elegant interface to work with your query results.

Example:
```python
import records

db = records.Database('postgres://...')
rows = db.query('select * from active_users') 

>>> rows[0]
<Record {"username": "model-t", "active": true, "name": "Henry Ford", "user_email": "model-t@gmail.com", "timezone": "2016-02-06 22:28:23.894202"}>

[**Sanic**](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) is a Flask-like Python 3.5+ web server that's written to go fast. It's based on the work done by the amazing folks at magicstack, and was inspired by this article: https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/.

On top of being Flask-like, Sanic supports async request handlers. This means you can use the new shiny async/await syntax from Python 3.5, making your code non-blocking and speedy.

Example:
```python
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import json


app = Sanic()


@app.route("/")
async def test(request):
    return json({"hello": "world"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

[**Locust**](https://github.com/locustio/locust) is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing tool. It is intended for load-testing web sites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle.

The idea is that during a test, a swarm of locusts will attack your website. The behavior of each locust (or test user if you will) is defined by you and the swarming process is monitored from a web UI in real-time. This will help you battle test and identify bottlenecks in your code before letting real users in.

Locust is completely event-based, and therefore it's possible to support thousands of concurrent users on a single machine. In contrast to many other event-based apps it doesn't use callbacks. Instead it uses light-weight processes, through gevent. Each locust swarming your site is actually running inside its own process (or greenlet, to be correct). This allows you to write very expressive scenarios in Python without complicating your code with callbacks.
