## G

[**git-secret**](https://github.com/sobolevn/git-secret)  —  a bash tool to store your private data inside a git repo. How’s that? Basically, it just encrypts, using gpg, the tracked files with the public keys of all the users that you trust. So everyone of them can decrypt these files using only their personal secret key. Why deal with all this private-public keys stuff? Well, to make it easier for everyone to manage access rights. There are no passwords that change. When someone is out - just delete his public key, re-encrypt the files, and he won’t be able to decrypt secrets anymore.

## K

[**Kerl**](https://github.com/kerl/kerl). Easy building and installing of Erlang/OTP instances. Kerl aims to be shell agnostic and its only dependencies, excluding what's required to actually build Erlang/OTP, are curl and git. All is done so that, once a specific release has been built, creating a new installation is as fast as possible.

## M

[**Mal**](https://github.com/kanaka/mal). Mal is a Clojure inspired Lisp interpreter

## N

[**Neofetch**](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) is a command-line system information tool written in bash 3.2+. 
Neofetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of Neofetch is to be used in screen-shots of your system. Neofetch shows the information other people want to see. 
There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.

The information by default is displayed alongside your operating system's logo. 
You can further configure Neofetch to instead use an image, a custom ASCII file, your wallpaper or nothing at all.
