        >
    </a>
</p>

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Use Airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The Airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

[**Certbot**](https://github.com/certbot/certbot) is part of EFF’s effort to encrypt the entire Internet. Secure communication over the Web relies on HTTPS, which requires the use of a digital certificate that lets browsers verify the identify of web servers (e.g., is that really google.com?). Web servers obtain their certificates from trusted third parties called certificate authorities (CAs). Certbot is an easy-to-use client that fetches a certificate from Let’s Encrypt—an open certificate authority launched by the EFF, Mozilla, and others—and deploys it to a web server.

Anyone who has gone through the trouble of setting up a secure website knows what a hassle getting and maintaining a certificate is. Certbot and Let’s Encrypt can automate away the pain and let you turn on and manage HTTPS with simple commands. Using Certbot and Let's Encrypt is free, so there’s no need to arrange payment.

How you use Certbot depends on the configuration of your web server. The best way to get started is to use our interactive guide. It generates instructions based on your configuration settings. In most cases, you’ll need root or administrator access to your web server to run Certbot.

If you’re using a hosted service and don’t have direct access to your web server, you might not be able to use Certbot. Check with your hosting provider for documentation about uploading certificates or using certificates issues by Let’s Encrypt.

Certbot is a fully-featured, extensible client for the Let's Encrypt CA (or any other CA that speaks the ACME protocol) that can automate the tasks of obtaining certificates and configuring webservers to use them. This client runs on Unix-based operating systems.

[**Hypothesis**](http://hypothesis.works) is a powerful testing library. 

It lets you write tests which are parametrized by a source of examples, then generates the 
simplest examples that make your tests fail. This lets you find more bugs with less work -
it's easy to use, stable, and advances the state of the art, so if you're not using 
Hypothesis to test your project you're missing out.

It works well for both simple and very complex tests - here's a short example: 

```python
@given(st.lists(st.floats(allow_nan=False)))
def test_mean(xs):
    """For any list of numbers, the mean is between the min and the max."""
    mean = sum(xs) / len(xs)
    assert min(xs) <= mean <= max(xs)
```
```
Falsifying example: test_mean(xs=[9.9792015476736e+291, 1.7976931348623157e+308])
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
AssertionError: mean=inf

Falsifying example: test_mean(xs=[])
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
MultipleFailures: Hypothesis found 2 distinct failures.
```

Oh, yeah - Hypothesis can find and independently minimise examples for multiple
bugs in a single test.  Awesome, isn't it!

Hypothesis makes it very easy to define your own strategies for examples, and ships with support
for Django, Numpy, Pandas, pytz, as well as most built-in types.  It can even work out how to
call functions or build your custom objects based on their type annotations!

See [hypothesis.works](http://hypothesis.works) for articles, tips, and testimonials;

## L

[**Locust**](https://github.com/locustio/locust) is an easy-to-use, distributed, user load testing tool. It is intended for load-testing web sites (or other systems) and figuring out how many concurrent users a system can handle.

The idea is that during a test, a swarm of locusts will attack your website. The behavior of each locust (or test user if you will) is defined by you and the swarming process is monitored from a web UI in real-time. This will help you battle test and identify bottlenecks in your code before letting real users in.

Locust is completely event-based, and therefore it's possible to support thousands of concurrent users on a single machine. In contrast to many other event-based apps it doesn't use callbacks. Instead it uses light-weight processes, through gevent. Each locust swarming your site is actually running inside its own process (or greenlet, to be correct). This allows you to write very expressive scenarios in Python without complicating your code with callbacks.

Supported: *Python 2/3*

[**Mimesis**](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis) is a fast and easy to use library for Python, which helps generate mock data for a variety of purposes. This data can be particularly useful during software development and testing. For example, it could be used to populate a testing database for a web application (Django, Flask, etc.) with user information such as email addresses, usernames, first names, last names, etc. The library was written with the use of tools from the standard Python library, and therefore, it does not have any side dependencies. Currently the library supports 33 languages and 22 class providers, supplying various data.

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis/master/.github/images/readme-logo.png">
    </p>
</a>

Basic Usage:

```python
>>> from mimesis import Person
>>> from mimesis.enums import Gender
>>> person = Person('en')

>>> person.full_name(gender=Gender.FEMALE)
'Antonetta Garrison'
```

You can specify a locale when creating providers and they will return data that is appropriate for the language or country associated with that locale. Mimesis currently includes support for 32 different [locales](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis#locales).

Using locales:

```python
>>> import mimesis

>>> en = mimesis.Person('en')
>>> de = mimesis.Person('de')
>>> ic = mimesis.Person('is')

>>> en.full_name()
'Carolin Brady'

>>> de.full_name()
'Sabrina Gutermuth'

>>> ic.full_name()
'Rósa Þórlindsdóttir'

[**Schemathesis**](https://github.com/schemathesis/schemathesis) is a modern API testing tool for web applications built with Open API and GraphQL specifications.

It reads the application schema and automatically generates test cases, which will ensure that your application is compliant with its schema.

The application under test could be written in any language; the only thing you need is a valid API schema in a supported format.

Simple to use and yet powerful to uncover hard-to-find errors thanks to the property-based testing approach backed by state-of-the-art [**Hypothesis**](http://hypothesis.works) library.

You can use Schemathesis in the command line:

```
schemathesis run --stateful=links --checks all http://0.0.0.0:8081/schema.yaml
```

![schemathesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/schemathesis/schemathesis/master/img/schemathesis.gif)

Or in your Python tests:

```python
import schemathesis

schema = schemathesis.from_uri("http://0.0.0.0:8081/schema.yaml")


@schema.parametrize()
def test_api(case):
    case.call_and_validate()
```

Both examples above will run hundreds of requests against the API under test and report all found failures and inconsistencies along with instructions to reproduce them.

It also has strict style validation of imports, types, strings, numbers, keywords. That goes way beyond PEP8.

Since internally it is just a `flake8` plugin, all you need to do is: run your `flake8`!

```
$ flake8 your_module.py
$ flake8 your_package/
