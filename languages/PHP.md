## PHP

[**Laravel**](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) is a web development framework. It has a very
efficient and concise API. It covers a lot of web developers needs: an ORM (named Eloquent) and DB
migrations,  Authentication and Authorizations, templating with Blade, routing, Browser testing
(named Laravel Dusk), API only (Lumen), assets compilation, etc. And all very well documented.
