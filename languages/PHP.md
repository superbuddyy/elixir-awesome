## PHP

[**Guzzle**](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) is a PHP HTTP client that makes it easy to send HTTP requests and trivial to integrate with web services.

- Simple interface for building query strings, POST requests, streaming large uploads, streaming large downloads, using HTTP cookies, uploading JSON data, etc...
- Can send both synchronous and asynchronous requests using the same interface.
- Uses PSR-7 interfaces for requests, responses, and streams. This allows you to utilize other PSR-7 compatible libraries with Guzzle.
- Abstracts away the underlying HTTP transport, allowing you to write environment and transport agnostic code; i.e., no hard dependency on cURL, PHP streams, sockets, or non-blocking event loops.
- Middleware system allows you to augment and compose client behavior.

[**Laravel**](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) is a web development framework. It has a very
efficient and concise API. It covers a lot of web developers needs: an ORM (named Eloquent) and DB
migrations,  Authentication and Authorizations, templating with Blade, routing, Browser testing
(named Laravel Dusk), API only (Lumen), assets compilation, etc. And all very well documented.
