How fast?

[**Clack**](https://github.com/fukamachi/clack) is a web application environment for Common Lisp inspired by Python’s WSGI and Ruby’s Rack.

Example:
```common-lisp
(defvar *handler*
    (clack:clackup
      (lambda (env)
        (declare (ignore env))
        '(200 (:content-type "text/plain") ("Hello, Clack!")))))
```
