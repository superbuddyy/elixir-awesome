[**compojure**](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure)  —  a small routing library for Ring that allows web applications to be composed of small, independent parts.

This small Compojure application demonstrates creating a Ring handler from two routes:

```clojure
(ns hello-world.core
  (:require [compojure.core :refer :all]
            [compojure.route :as route]))
(defroutes app
  (GET "/" [] "<h1>Hello World</h1>")
  (route/not-found "<h1>Page not found</h1>"))
```

[**Aleph**](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph) exposes data from the network as a Manifold stream, which can easily be transformed into a java.io.InputStream, core.async channel, Clojure sequence, or many other byte representations. It exposes simple default wrappers for HTTP, TCP, and UDP, but allows access to full performance and flexibility of the underlying Netty library.

[**Datascript**](https://github.com/tonsky/datascript)  —  an immutable in-memory database and Datalog query engine in Clojure and ClojureScript.

[**Quil**](https://github.com/quil/quil) is a Clojure/ClojureScript library for creating interactive drawings and animations.

[**yada** ](https://github.com/juxt/yada) —  a web library for Clojure, designed to support the creation of production services via HTTP.

Typically, yada handlers are created from a configuation expressed in data.

```clojure
(require '[yada.yada :as yada])

(yada/handler
  {:methods
    {:get
      {:produces "text/html"
       :response "<h1>Hello World!</h1>"}}})
```

[**Hoplon**](https://github.com/hoplon/hoplon)  —  a set of tools and libraries for making web applications.

[**Pedestal**](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) is a set of libraries written in Clojure that aims to bring both the language and its principles (Simplicity, Power and Focus) to server-side development.

[Here](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal/tree/master/samples) you can find samples.

[**Jepsen**](https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen) is a Clojure library. A test is a Clojure program which uses the Jepsen library to set up a distributed system, run a bunch of operations against that system, and verify that the history of those operations makes sense. Jepsen has been used to verify everything from eventually-consistent commutative databases to linearizable coordination systems to distributed task schedulers. It can also generate graphs of performance and availability, helping you characterize how a system responds to different faults. See aphyr.com for examples of the sorts of analyses you can carry out with Jepsen.

[**Selmer**](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer). A fast, Django inspired template system for Clojure.

Selmer templates consist of plain text that contains embedded expression and filter tags. While Selmer
is primarily meant for HTML generation, it can be used for templating any text.

Selmer compiles the template files and replaces any tags with the corresponding functions for handling
dynamic content. The compiled template can then be rendered given a context map.

For example, if we wanted to render a string containing a name variable we could write the following:

```clojure
(use 'selmer.parser)

(render "Hello {{name}}!" {:name "Yogthos"})
=>"Hello Yogthos!"
```

To render a file we can call `render-file` instead:

```clojure
(use 'selmer.parser)

(render-file "home.html" {:name "Yogthos"})
