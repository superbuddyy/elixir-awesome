## A

[**Angular**](https://github.com/angular/angular)  —  The successor to AngularJS.

Angular is a development platform for building mobile and desktop web applications.

---
[**Angular Material**](https://github.com/angular/material2)  —  Material Design components for Angular 2.

Angular Material brings high-quality UI components built with Angular 2 and TypeScript, following the Material Design spec. These components will serve as an example of how to write Angular code following best practices.

[Check out the available components](https://material.angular.io/components)

## I

[**Ionic**](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic)  —  A complete mobile toolkit, built for web developers.

Know how to build websites? Then you already know how to build mobile apps. Ionic Framework offers the best web and native app components for building highly interactive native and progressive web apps with Angular.

## N

[**NativeScript**](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript)  —  Framework to develop mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms.

NativeScript empowers you to access native APIs from JavaScript directly. The framework currently provides iOS and Android runtimes for rich mobile development and can be utilized in a number of diverse use cases.

## Q

[**qwik**](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik) - The HTML-first framework. Instant apps of any size with ~ 1kb JS

Qwik is a new kind of web framework that can deliver instant loading web applications at any size or complexity. Your sites and apps can boot with about 1kb of JS (regardless of application complexity), and achieve consistent performance at scale. Qwik is so fast because it allows fully interactive sites to load with almost no JavaScript and pickup from where the server left off.

As users interact with the site, only the necessary parts of the site load on-demand. This precision lazy-loading is what makes Qwik so quick.

## R

[**RxJS**](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs) - A reactive programming library for JavaScript

RxJS is a library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. This project is a rewrite of Reactive-Extensions/RxJS with better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface

## S

[**Solid**](https://github.com/solidjs/solid)  —  A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Solid is a declarative JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Instead of using a Virtual DOM, it compiles its templates to real DOM nodes and updates them with fine-grained reactions. Declare your state and use it throughout your app, and when a piece of state changes, only the code that depends on it will rerun.

[**Stryker**](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker)  —  A mutation testing framework for JavaScript.

Stryker enables you to measure the quality of your unit tests by using a technique called mutation testing. Stryker will insert small bugs (mutations) into your code and check if your tests can detect the bugs.

## T

[**TypeScript**](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) - The language itself.

TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript. TypeScript adds optional types, classes, and modules to JavaScript. TypeScript supports tools for large-scale JavaScript applications for any browser, for any host, on any OS. TypeScript compiles to readable, standards-based JavaScript.

---
[**TypeScriptToLua**](https://github.com/TypeScriptToLua/TypeScriptToLua) - A TypeScript to Lua transpiler.

A generic TypeScript to Lua transpiler. Write your code in TypeScript and publish Lua!

Large projects written in lua can become hard to maintain and make it easy to make mistakes. Writing code in TypeScript instead improves maintainability, readability and robustness, with the added bonus of good IDE support. This project is useful in any environment where Lua code is accepted, with the powerful option of simply declaring any existing API using TypeScript declaration files.

[**tinyhttp**](https://github.com/talentlessguy/tinyhttp) — modern Express-like web-framework.

tinyhttp is a modern Express-like web framework written in TypeScript and compiled to native ESM, that uses a bare minimum amount of dependencies trying to avoid legacy hell.

Nowadays most of the JavaScript applications, both backend or frontend, are filled with a lot of `node_modules` bloat. While modern Node.js versions support almost all latest JavaScript features, frameworks still pull garbage dependencies like `array-flatten`, even though it has been added to Node in 2018. tinyhttp tries to solve this problem by not relying on any polyfills and targeting the latest stable ECMAScript standard (ES2019 is supported by Node 12 LTS). Moreover, the framework targets both CommonJS legacy modules and modern standard ESM modules which you can use in both LTS and modern versions of Node with no extra setup required.

## V

[**Visual Studio Code**](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) - Open source code editor.

Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.

[**Vue.js**](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a **progressive framework** for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable, and can easily scale between a library and a framework depending on different use cases. It consists of an approachable core library that focuses on the view layer only, and an ecosystem of supporting libraries that helps you tackle complexity in large Single-Page Applications.

[**Vite**](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) - Next generation frontend tooling. It's fast!

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:
- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

## X

[**Xterm.js**](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js) - A terminal frontend for the web platform

Xterm.js is a terminal component that powers many standalone and integrated terminals such as Visual Studio Code, Hyper and Theia.
