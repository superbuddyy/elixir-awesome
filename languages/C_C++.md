## C and C++

[**Qt**](https://www.qt.io/) is an LGPL application framework supported on most platforms - including embedded -, and covers most of C++ application development needs : GUI widgets, event loop, networking, serialization, reflection, javascript engines, web browser integration... As well as a declarative reactive user-interface programming language based on Javascript, QML that can even be used for 3D content creation.

[**NumPy**](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) is the fundamental package needed for scientific computing with Python.
This package contains:

   * a powerful N-dimensional array object
   * sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
   * tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
   * useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.

It derives from the old Numeric code base and can be used as a replacement for Numeric. It also adds the features introduced by numarray and can be used to replace numarray.

[**Electron**](https://github.com/electron/electron) lets you write cross-platform desktop applications
using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and
[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org) and is used by the [Atom
editor](https://github.com/atom/atom) and many other [apps](http://electron.atom.io/apps).

[**µWS**](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) is one of the most lightweight, efficient & scalable WebSocket server implementations available. It features an easy-to-use, fully async object-oriented interface and scales to millions of connections using only a fraction of memory compared to the competition. While performance and scalability are two of our top priorities, we consider security, stability and standards compliance paramount. License is zlib/libpng (very permissive & suits commercial applications).

[**RethinkDB**](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb)   —  the first open-source scalable database built for realtime applications. It exposes a new database access model — instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell the database to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB allows developers to build scalable realtime apps in a fraction of the time with less effort.

[**Robomongo**](https://github.com/paralect/robomongo) is a shell-centric cross-platform MongoDB management tool. Unlike most other MongoDB admin UI tools, Robomongo embeds the actual mongo shell in a tabbed interface with access to a shell command line as well as GUI interaction.

[**Lwan**](https://github.com/lpereira/lwan/) is a high-performance & scalable web server for glibc/Linux
platforms.

In development for almost 4 years, Lwan was until now a personal research
effort that focused mostly on building a **solid infrastructure** for
a lightweight and speedy web server:

  - Low memory footprint (~500KiB for 10k idle connections)
  - Minimal memory allocations & copies
  - Minimal system calls
  - Hand-crafted HTTP request parser
  - Files are served using the most efficient way according to their size
    - No copies between kernel and userland for files larger than 16KiB
    - Smaller files are sent using vectored I/O of memory-mapped buffers
    - Header overhead is considered before compressing small files
  - Mostly wait-free multi-threaded design
  - Diminute code base with roughly 7200 lines of C code

It is now transitioning into a fully working, capable HTTP server. It is
not, however, as feature-packed as other popular web servers. But it is
[free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), so scratching
your own itches and making Lwan hum the way you want it to is possible.

[**netdata**](https://github.com/firehol/netdata) is a system for distributed real-time performance and health monitoring. It provides unparalleled insights, in real-time, of everything happening on the system it runs (including applications such as web and database servers), using modern interactive web dashboards.

netdata is fast and efficient, designed to permanently run on all systems (physical & virtual servers, containers, IoT devices), without disrupting their core function.

[**Nuklear**](https://github.com/vurtun/nuklear) - is a minimal state immediate mode graphical user interface toolkit written in ANSI C and licensed under public domain. It was designed as a simple embeddable user interface for application and does not have any dependencies, a default renderbackend or OS window and input handling but instead provides a very modular library approach by using simple input state for input and draw commands describing primitive shapes as output. So instead of providing a layered library that tries to abstract over a number of platform and render backends it only focuses on the actual UI.

[**MXNet**](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix the flavours of symbolic programming and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. In its core, a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The library is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.
