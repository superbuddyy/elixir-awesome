[**Haxe CheckStyle Documentation**](https://haxecheckstyle.github.io/docs/haxe-checkstyle/home.html) - Haxe Checkstyle is a static analysis tool to help developers write Haxe code that adheres to a coding standard. Not only improve readability, but also allows other team members to better understand each otherâ€™s code. Ideal for any project that wants to enforce coding conventions.

---
[**HaxeFoundation**](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) - Active repository and websites that offer examples, usage and guidances for using Hexe. Whole the Cross-Platform Toolkit

---
[**HXElectron**](https://github.com/tong/hxelectron) - Haxe type definitions for electron, a framework for building cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## I
[**Iron**](https://github.com/armory3d/iron) is a 3D engine core library built with Kha and Haxe. Powering Armory.

## K
[**Kha**](https://github.com/Kode/Kha) is a low level sdk for building games and media applications in a portable way.
Think SDL, but super-charged. Based on the Haxe programming language and the krafix shader-compiler it can cross-compile your code and
optimize your assets for even the most obscure systems. Kha is so portable, it can in fact run on top of other game engines and its
generational graphics and audio api design gets the best out of every target, supporting super fast 2D graphics just as well as high
end 3D graphics. Also, Kha probably added a new target while you were reading this text.
