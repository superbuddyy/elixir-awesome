## C++

[**Qt**](https://www.qt.io/) is an LGPL application framework supported on most platforms - including embedded -, and covers most of C++ application development needs : GUI widgets, event loop, networking, serialization, reflection, javascript engines, web browser integration... As well as a declarative reactive user-interface programming language based on Javascript, QML that can even be used for 3D content creation.

[**µWS**](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) is one of the most lightweight, efficient & scalable WebSocket server implementations available. It features an easy-to-use, fully async object-oriented interface and scales to millions of connections using only a fraction of memory compared to the competition. While performance and scalability are two of our top priorities, we consider security, stability and standards compliance paramount. License is zlib/libpng (very permissive & suits commercial applications).

[**RethinkDB**](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb)   —  the first open-source scalable database built for realtime applications. It exposes a new database access model — instead of polling for changes, the developer can tell the database to continuously push updated query results to applications in realtime. RethinkDB allows developers to build scalable realtime apps in a fraction of the time with less effort.

[**MXNet**](https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet) is a deep learning framework designed for both efficiency and flexibility. It allows you to mix the flavours of symbolic programming and imperative programming to maximize efficiency and productivity. In its core, a dynamic dependency scheduler that automatically parallelizes both symbolic and imperative operations on the fly. A graph optimization layer on top of that makes symbolic execution fast and memory efficient. The library is portable and lightweight, and it scales to multiple GPUs and multiple machines.

[**Bitcoin**](https://bitcoin.org/) is an innovative payment network and a new kind of money. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and [everyone can take part](https://bitcoin.org/en/support-bitcoin). Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.
