## A

[**Accelerate**](https://www.acceleratehs.org/) is a general-purpose library which aims to provide high performance parallel array computations in Haskell. It allows creating large high performance computing tasks that can execute on a variety of CPUs and GPUs as well as hardware accelerators.

---

## D

[**Diagrams**](https://diagrams.github.io/) is a Haskell library to create declarative graphics. It is a powerful, flexible, domain specific language which allows describing graphics in terms of their elements (e.g., squares, circles, lines) and their positions (absolute or relative to each other). Output can be a raster image (e.g., BMP) or a vector image or just a canvas in other GUI applications.

---

## G

[**Gifcurry**](https://github.com/lettier/gifcurry) is the open-source, Haskell-built video editor for GIF makers. Load a video, make some edits, and save it as a GIF—Gifcurry makes your life easy! Most video formats should work, so go wild. And since it's made with Haskell, you know it's good.

[**Glance**](https://github.com/rgleichman/glance) is a visual syntax for the programming language Haskell. The goal of this project is to increase programmer happiness and productivity by allowing programmers to create and understand programs in new and different ways. Currently, the Glance executable produces a visual representation of your code in the form of an SVG image when given a textual Haskell source file. In the future, I hope to create a visual editor for Haskell. Please scroll down to see some example images.

---

## H

[**Hakyll**](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) is a static website generator written in Haskell. The compiler transforms files in various formats into HTML files which can then be served by a web server. The project offers a starter template but is also highly configurable. Multiple CSS themes are available.

---

[**hadolint**](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hadolint)  —  a smarter Dockerfile linter that helps you build best practice Docker images. The linter is parsing the Dockerfile into an AST and performs rules on top of the AST. hadolint written in Haskell.

---

[**hledger**](https://hledger.org/) is a Haskell library for plain-text accounting. It allows keeping track of one's personal finances as well as supporting situations with large number of accounts that need to be tracked. It supports importing data from multiple formats. The project also showcases multiple GUI editors and a web interface.

---

[**http-client**](https://github.com/snoyberg/http-client) is a mega-repo for housing the http-client family of packages for Haskell. These packages provide a low level HTTP client engine (http-client), different backends for providing SSL support (http-client-tls and http-client-openssl), and higher-level APIs for user convenience (http-conduit).

--- 

## P

[**Pandoc**](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra, GitHub-Flavored Markdown, MultiMarkdown, and (subsets of) Textile, reStructuredText, HTML, LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, Haddock markup, OPML, Emacs Org mode, DocBook, txt2tags, EPUB, ODT and Word docx; and it can write plain text, Markdown, CommonMark, PHP Markdown Extra,GitHub-Flavored Markdown, MultiMarkdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML5, LaTeX (including beamer slide shows), ConTeXt, RTF, OPML, DocBook, OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, GNU Texinfo, MediaWiki markup, DokuWiki markup, ZimWiki markup, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 or v3), FictionBook2, Textile, groff man pages, Emacs Org mode, AsciiDoc, InDesign ICML, TEI Simple, and Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js or S5 HTML slide shows. It can also produce PDF output on systems where LaTeX, ConTeXt, or wkhtmltopdf is installed.

---

[**postgrest**](https://github.com/begriffs/postgrest)  —  PostgREST serves a fully RESTful API from any existing PostgreSQL database. It provides a cleaner, more standards-compliant, faster API than you are likely to write from scratch. PostgREST written in Haskell.

---

## S

[**Stack**](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) is a cross-platform program for developing Haskell projects. It is intended for Haskellers both new and experienced.

---

[**Stan**](https://kowainik.github.io/projects/stan) is a static analyzer for Haskell programs. It reports common programming errors and suggest coding style improvements as well as changes that would make the project be more resilient, secure and bug free.

---

## T

[**TaskLite**](https://tasklite.org/introduction.html) is a CLI-based task tracking application, similar to TaskWarrior but with a focus on performance and prevention of bugs that would result in data loss. It is built using Haskell and SQLite.

---

[**Termonad**](https://github.com/cdepillabout/termonad) is a full featured terminal emulator written in Haskell. It can be used as a replacement to iTerm2, Gnome Terminal, KTerm and many other terminal emulators.

---

## U

[**Unison**](https://www.unisonweb.org/) is a programming language built for the elastic distributed computation future. All functions and code is immutable and referenced via its content. The Unison compiler is written in Haskell.

---

## X

[**XMonad**](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad) is a dynamically tiled window manager which is fully configurable in Haskell. It automates windows positioning, reducing time spent aligning new windows and searching for them.
